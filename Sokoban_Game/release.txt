Sokoban Beta Release Notes

Enhancements:
- Created a new logo for the splash screen as well as adding coins next to each option for a little more pizazz.
- Changes the sprites of the baggage to coins since the dots looked to much alike the player sprite and 
  it fit my sound effects better as well.
- Added low volume electric music in the background.
- Added 5 more levels for the player to try with three of them being challenge stages where the areas are in different spots.
- Added a prompt for player to put in their name after finishing a level which then gets put into a text file to save high scores.
- If a player does not fill in all 3 characters, each missing character is replaced with an 'A' to replicate old arcade high scores.
- If a player puts in over 3 characters, only the first 3 characters are taken.
- The high scores are now saved in ascending order due to the fact that the fastest times should be on top.
- Checking the high scores now only shows the top 5 scores.
- Changed the highscores text file to be written into the resources of the game folder since it will automatically be found 
  no matter what computer it is put on without the need of creating a new folder such as tmp.

Bugs:
- (FIXED) As the player goes to put the last baggage into the last area, the high score prompt will show up 
  before that last baggage in shown to be in the area.
- (FIXED) Time was not resetting when restarting the game for the completion screen.
- (FIXED) The high score prompt was writing in names that are larger than 3 characters into the text file.
- (FIXED) Without a tmp folder, finding the high scores txt file is impossible.
- (FIXED) If a player checks the scores when they first open up the game you will get an error since it cannot find the file due to it not
  existing until the player puts in their first score.
