# Jake Vissicchio
I am a student at Marist with a love of Computers and Games ever since I was a child. 
Ever since I have started taking Computer Science courses at Marist I have developed a huge fascination of coding and wish to keep
honing my skills in order to be the best software engineer I can be.
In my Github you can find past projects that I have created.
